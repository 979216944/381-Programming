# Math 381 Programming Introduction

This repository holds the files and instructions you will need to get your computer ready to learn about using Python to solve linear programming problems.

## Our set-up
We will be using Python in a Jupyter notebook as a scripting language and Gurobi as the programming solver. This will allow a user-friendly programming environment that shouldn't be too difficult even for first-time programmers while giving you the power of a state-of-the-art optimizing engine to solve your problems.

## Things to do BEFORE COMING TO LECTURE
1. **Get a (free) Gurobi academic license**
You can [visit this page]{http://www.gurobi.com/registration/academic-license-reg} to fill out a form to get your academic license. You will need to create an account using your UW email address and then log in to get your key.
    
Keep this until later.
1. **Install Anaconda and Python**
*Even if you have Python installed on your computer already*, you will need to install the distribution that comes with Anaconda. This will ensure you have a compatible installation which includes Gurobi and Jupyter and everything else you will need.



1. **Install Gurobi for Python**

1. **Download these files to your computer**
